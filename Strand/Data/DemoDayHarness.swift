// MARK: - DEBUG-only day-cycle screenshot harness
//
// A promo-animation aid (NOT shipped). When the process is launched with `--demo-hour <Int>` (the two
// args arrive separately via `simctl launch`), this pins the Today screen to a single believable
// "moment in the day": it swaps the day-cycle SCENE to that hour's illustration and overrides a small
// set of Today read-outs (Effort, greeting, readiness badge, Synthesis copy, and the Stress / HRV /
// Resting-HR cards) with a hand-tuned per-hour value so a sweep of `--demo-hour 2 … 22` captures every
// background with a plausible stat progression across the day.
//
// Gating: the WHOLE file is `#if DEBUG`, so it is stripped from every Release build. At runtime nothing
// changes unless `--demo-hour` is present: `applyLaunchArgsIfNeeded()` leaves `active == nil` otherwise,
// and every override in TodayView is `(DemoDayHarness.active != nil)`-gated — so with no arg the screen
// is byte-identical to the seeded demo. Pairs with `--demo-seed` (AppleDemoSeeder), which supplies the
// underlying synthetic dataset; this harness only re-presents a few values on top of it. Everything here
// is SYNTHETIC — nothing is real biometric data.

/// One pinned "moment in the day" the harness renders. All values are presentation-only overrides.
